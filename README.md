Description:
------------
This is a simple number guessing game implemented in JavaScript using Node.js. 
The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has a limited 
number of attempts to guess it correctly. The difficulty level can be selected at 
the beginning of the game.

How to Play:
------------
1. Run the script using Node.js:  
   $ node game.js  

2. Select a difficulty level:
   - Easy: 10 attempts
   - Medium: 5 attempts
   - Hard: 3 attempts

3. Enter your guess (a number between 1 and 100).
4. The game will provide hints if your guess is too high or too low.
5. Continue guessing until you either find the correct number or run out of attempts.
6. If you guess correctly, you win! If you use all attempts, the game ends, and the 
   correct number is revealed.
